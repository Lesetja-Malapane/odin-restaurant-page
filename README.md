# odin-restaurant-page

This is a simple restaurant page website created to learn and practice:

- **npm** for managing packages
- **JavaScript modules** (exporting and importing functions)

- **Image loader** and **CSS loader** for handling images and styles

The project demonstrates basic usage of Webpack plugins and loaders, modular JavaScript, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

## Features

- Three meal options with descriptions and images
- Modular code structure using ES6 imports/exports
- Dynamic DOM updates based on user interaction

- Images loaded and managed via Webpack asset modules
- Simple navigation using buttons
